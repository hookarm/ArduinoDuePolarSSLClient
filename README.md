ArduinoDuePolarSSLClient
========================

This is a sample Arduino Due sketch connecting to a PolarSSL server using PSK authentication.

Building on Windows: you will need some Unix tools like GNU make, ls, etc. An easy way to get them all is via [msysgit](https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit).

In the Makefile, change the paths to point to your Arduino installation.

Do `make compile` to compile, `make upload` to upload the sketch to the Due.
